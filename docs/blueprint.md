# **App Name**: Ethereal Canvas

## Core Features:

- Interactive Background: Creates an interactive canvas background that responds to mouse movements with a soft, ethereal brush effect.
- Custom Cursor: Replaces the default cursor with a custom-styled circle that provides visual feedback of the brush position.
- Brushstroke Dynamics: Implements a dynamic brushstroke that starts with a maximum radius and gradually decays as the mouse moves, creating a natural 'brush wear' effect.
- Brush Reload: Automatically resets the brush radius to its maximum size when the mouse stops moving for a short period, simulating the action of reloading the brush.
- Gradient Painting: Uses radial gradients to simulate smooth and diffuse brush strokes with white color and low opacity at the center.
- Responsive Canvas: Adapts the canvas size to different screen dimensions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Vibrant orange (#e74c3c) as the primary background color, providing a bright and energetic feel.
- Text color: White (#ffffff) for all text elements to ensure high contrast and readability against the orange background.
- Brush color: A brighter shade of orange (e.g., #FFA500) for the brush strokes to make them stand out against the background.
- Headline font: A modern sans-serif font for the main title, ensuring clarity and impact.
- Body font: A clean and readable sans-serif font for body text and subtitles.
- Minimalist icons, if used, should be in white to maintain consistency and contrast.
- Full-screen canvas with all content centered both vertically and horizontally to maximize visual impact.
- Subtle animations for transitions and interactive elements, maintaining a smooth and engaging user experience.
